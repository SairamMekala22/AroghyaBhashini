## 🔍 Project Description

**Aroghyabhashini** is an assistive communication system (sometimes referred to as an “artificial vocal cord”) designed to bridge the gap for individuals who cannot speak or have speech impairments. It enables users to input, translate, or synthesize language in a seamless, natural manner—effectively giving “voice” where none exists.

The project provides:

- **Real-time translation & voice synthesis** capabilities (e.g. converting typed or interpreted input into audible speech),
- Support for multiple languages/localizations,
- A friendly user interface optimized for ease of use by people with limited mobility,
- Integration with language APIs and modular architecture for future expansion.

In short, Aroghyabhashini is not just a tool but a companion that amplifies silent voices.
